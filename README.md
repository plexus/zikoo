# Zikoo (字庫)

A rewrite/repurpose of [Zikoo.org](http://zikoo.org), a learning tool for students of Mandarin.

Zikoo serves as an example of what is possible by combining [Hexp](http://github.com/plexus/hexp), [Hexp UI](http://github.com/plexus/hexp_ui), [Ting](http://github.com/plexus/ting) and [Analects](http://github.com/plexus/analects).

## Who is behind this

Zikoo, as well as the libraries it depends on (Hexp, Hexp UI, Ting and Analects) are being actively developed by [Arne Brasseur](http://arnebrasseur.net). If you like what you see, consider [supporting me on Gittip!](https://www.gittip.com/plexus)
